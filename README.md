**Vision 100k Student Management System** is an open-source project aimed at revolutionizing the management of secondary 
schools in Nigeria through the use of technology. Built using Symfony 7, this system is designed to provide a modern, 
scalable, and efficient solution for managing student data, academic records, and administrative functions.

## Project Vision

The vision of the **Vision 100k Student Management System** is to empower secondary schools in Nigeria by providing an 
advanced digital platform for school administration. By leveraging technology, the system seeks to:

   stakeholders (teachers, students, and parents).
- **Promote Transparency**: Ensure clear, accessible, and accurate record-keeping for academic performance, attendance,
  and other key metrics.
- **Facilitate Technological Integration**: Introduce technology into everyday school management processes, encouraging
  schools to adopt modern solutions for their administrative needs.
- **Expand Accessibility**: Ensure that the system is user-friendly, scalable, and accessible to schools across Nigeria,
  regardless of their size or technical capacity.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Responsive design improvements and dedicated mobile app integration.

## Features

Key features that will be developed as part of this project include:

- **Student Information Management**: Centralized storage and management of student personal details, academic records,
  and progress reports.
- **Grading and Reports**: Tools for teachers to enter grades, generate report cards, and provide feedback to students
  and parents.
- **User Role Management**: Secure, role-based access for administrators, teachers, students, and parents.
- **Notifications and Alerts**: Communication tools for sending announcements, reminders, and updates to parent,
  students, and staff.
